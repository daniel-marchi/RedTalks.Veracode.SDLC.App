# CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect') in VeraDemo
VeraDemo uses untrusted data while building URL redirects. This leaves the application vulnerable to malicious users controlling the destination website served when navigating through VeraDemo.

# Mitigate
* Verify the redirect by making sure it stays within the app space. Whitelists can come in handy to validate the target parameter before it is returned. 

# Remediate
* Never use untrusted data for constructing URLs. Maintain a whitelist of known URL's and utilize external data as a selector rather than redirecting.
