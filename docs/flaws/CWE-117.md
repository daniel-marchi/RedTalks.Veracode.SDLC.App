# CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs in VeraDemo
VeraDemo has a lot of logging statements, unfortunately it uses untrusted data in the logging statements. This allows an attacker to inject their own "Enters" (Carriage Return & Line Feed or just Line Feed) and thereby inject their own log lines.

Consequences of this may be that auditors can not trust log files in case of an incident or attackers may attempt to inject HTML and trick an administrator into executing it and causing XSS on an administrator part of the application.

# Mitigation
* Encode data that contains LF or CR characters or remove them

# Remediation
* Do not use untrusted data in logging statements
* Validate using a whitelist of hardcoded values
* Use a logging format that differentiates between a log statement and runtime data. (JSON, Greylog)

* [CWE-117](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/117.html)
