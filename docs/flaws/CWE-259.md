# CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password in VeraDemo
VeraDemo has a hard-coded password within it's settings.py file (django settings), which is used for it's own inbound authentication or for outbound communication if needed. A hard-coded password leads to authenticagtion failure that can be difficult for an admin to detect, thus allowing any user to extract that password since it's hard-coded on the client side and an extraction from a binary is simple.

# Mitigate
* Ensure the secret key in the settings.py file is not present and is in production secret 

# Remediate 
* Remove the secret key/hard-coded passwords anywhere in code.
