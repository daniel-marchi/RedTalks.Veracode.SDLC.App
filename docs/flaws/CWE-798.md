# CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials in VeraDemo 
VeraDemos reset controller (resetController.py) contains hard-coded credentials in it's code. Hard-coded credentials allow an attacker to bypass authentication as the "hole" for the attacker can be difficult to detect. 

# Mitigate
* For outbound requests, store credentials outside of the code in a strongly-protected configuration file that has no access to outsiders.
* For inbound requests, apply one-way hashes and store them to configuration files with proper access control, that way the attacker will have to compute more hashes as the password will now have randomly assigned salts for each seperate hash. 

# Remediate
* Limit credentials to the back-end to only perform actions for the front-end, rather than giving full access within the code.
