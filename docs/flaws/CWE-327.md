# CWE-327: Use of Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm in VeraDemo
VeraDemo utilizes a vulnerable cryptographic algorithm known as hashlib.md5. This hashing algorithm has been deemed insecure as researchers over the years have proven that it is simple to unhash any info it hashes

# Mitigate
* Utilize salting with a longer hash function such as SHA-256

# Remediate
* Bcrypt or PBKDF2 are better alternatives as they are more robust.
