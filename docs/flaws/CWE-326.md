# CWE-326 Inadequate Encryption Strength in Verademo
VeraDemo does not contain any significant stength in terms of encryption. It stores data using the cryptography library which is a solid hashing algorithm, but it is not strong enough for the protection needed in this app. Weak encryption can fall victim to brute force attacks, the weaker the encryption, the higher the sucess of an attack.

# Mitigate
* Ensure the encrypting algorithm is well suited for the app

# Remediate
* Utilize a more up-to-date/stronger encryption algorithm
