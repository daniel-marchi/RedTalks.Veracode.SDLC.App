# CWE-331: Insufficient Entropy in VeraDemo
Verademo utilizes a standard number generator, which leaves back patterns or clusters of values that are likely to occur when the app is ran. Attackers can brute force these generators as it leaves back the values that are likely to occur, giving them access. 

# Mediate 
* Determine the entropy necessary for the app to adequately provide randomness. Increase number of bits of objects such as keys and seeds. 

# Remediate
* Utilize other randomizers such as os.urandom (python3+)
