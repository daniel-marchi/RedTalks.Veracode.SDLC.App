# CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data in VeraDemo
VeraDemo deserializes data without checking if the resulting data will be valid. Deserialized data can be altered without using any accessor functions if it does not use cryptography to protect itself. Data that is untrusted should not be trusted. This can be found in the userController.py file (decoded = base64.b64decode(userDetailsCookie))

# Mitigate
* Have the serialized data get signed and then have its signature verified before utilizing the data. 

# Remediate 
* When deserializing, populate the new object, rather than just deserializing, this allows data to flow through safe input validation.
