# CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in VeraDemo
The web server in verademo receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination. Attackers can make this seem like the server is sending the request, which can bypass any access controls that may exist. This can be found in homeController
